# Lab 1 â€” GHDL and GTKWave

### Summary
For this lab, I had to download and configure GHDL and GTKWave to function properly.
I used this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2GyAIYwZbw) to actually guide me throughout this initial process.

#### Half Adder
For the first example, we had to work with Half Adder. A soon as I got through the video and ran the Half Adder example, I got the following results.

#### D Flip Flop
For the second example, I chose to do FlipFlop. I downloaded the necessary files off of the GitHub and ran essentially the same code necessary for the Half Adder example, just with a change in appropriate file used. After running GDKWave, I got the following results.
