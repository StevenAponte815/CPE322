# Lab 1 â€” GHDL and GTKWave

### Summary
For this lab, I had to download and configure GHDL and GTKWave to function properly.
I used this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2GyAIYwZbw) to actually guide me throughout this initial process.

As soon as I got through the video and ran the Half Adder example, I got the following results.
