# Lab 5 â€” Paho-MQTT

### Summary
For Lab 5, I used the Raspberry Pi from Lab 2 to install Paho-MQTT.
I used Dr. Lu's [Lesson 5](https://github.com/kevinwlu/iot/tree/master/lesson5) to guide me through this.

#### Following the Commands
I logged into the Raspberry Pi and started following the slides and the Lesson 5 IoT for the lab, as listed below.

Once I was able to log in, I started installing Mosquitto.

I continued by continuing with the other commands as well.

I was able to run the Terminal 1 and 2 commands too. This is also the setup I had for the 2 terminals.

Once I got Paho installed, I started to run code on one Terminal and publishing it to the other.

I was able to start the code for Terminal 1 and get into the nano of subraspi

I did the same for Terminal 2

This was my final run with the python3 code for both Terminal 1 and Terminal 2
