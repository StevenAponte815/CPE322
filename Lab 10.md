# Lab 10 â€” Blockchain

### Summary
For Lab 10, I used the raspberry pi to follow along.
I used Dr. Lu's [Lesson 10](https://github.com/kevinwlu/iot/tree/master/lesson10) to guide me through this.

#### Following the Commands
I essentially followed the slides on the lecture to get this lab started.

I tried running the http://127.0.0.1:5000/ website, but wasn't able to connect. I tried to see if I could do it with the VNCviewer and that wasn't working either.
