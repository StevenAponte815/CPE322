# Lab 6 â€” Node.js and Pystache

### Summary
For Lab 6, I used the my laptop and raspberry pi to download Node.js and Pystache.
I used Dr. Lu's [Lesson 6](https://github.com/kevinwlu/iot/tree/master/lesson6) to guide me through this.

#### Following the Commands
I essentially followed the slides on the lecture to get this lab started.

I was able to download Node.js

After many tries, I was able to get the VNCview working.

I started running the node commands on the raspberry pi.

I was able to get the node hello.js working.

When I ran the http.js code, this is what I got.

I went straight to downloading Pystache as well once I had Node.js ready.

I also ran the say_hello.mustache and py code as well.
