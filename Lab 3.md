# Lab 3 â€” Python

### Summary
For Lab 3, I used the Raspberry Pi from last lab to install some required python packages.
I used Dr. Lu's [Lesson 3](https://github.com/kevinwlu/iot/tree/master/lesson3) to guide me through this.

#### Following the Commands
I logged into the Raspberry Pi and started following the slides and the Lesson 3 IoT for the lab, as listed below.

I began by following the Github and doing the following commands 
> $ sudo apt update
>  $ sudo apt install python3-pip
>  $ pip3 -V
>  $ pip3 list

I got the following for these commands.

Once everything was installed, I was able to continue with the commands from the Lab 3 slides.

For some reason, sun.py command wouldn't work.

But I was able to continue with the moon.py command and the others. Being able to finish the rest of the commands without problems.
