# Lab 2 â€” Command Line

### Summary
For this lab, I had to acquire and get a hold of a raspberry pi. Thankfully, Dr. Lu was able to lend me one for the semester, and I was able to get to work on this. To get started off, I needed to make sure that the SD card in the raspberry pi had to correct OS on it. Thanks to my last co-op, I knew how to set these up. I downloaded Raspberry Pi imager and selected everything that was necessary
I used this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2GyAIYwZbw) to actually guide me throughout this initial process.

#### Half Adder
For the first example, we had to work with Half Adder. A soon as I got through the video and ran the Half Adder example, I got the following results.

#### D Flip Flop
For the second example, I chose to do FlipFlop. I downloaded the necessary files off of the GitHub and ran essentially the same code necessary for the Half Adder example, just with a change in appropriate file used. After running GDKWave, I got the following results.
