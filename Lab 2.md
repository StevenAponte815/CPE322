# Lab 2 â€” Command Line

### Summary
For this lab, I had to acquire and get a hold of a raspberry pi. Thankfully, Dr. Lu was able to lend me one for the semester, and I was able to get to work on this. To get started off, I needed to make sure that the SD card in the Raspberry Pi had to correct OS on it. Thanks to my last co-op, I knew how to set these up. I downloaded    Raspberry Pi imager and selected everything that was necessary.

I used Dr. Lu's [Lesson 1](https://github.com/kevinwlu/iot/tree/master/lesson1) and [Lesson 2](https://github.com/kevinwlu/iot/tree/master/lesson2) to also guide me through this

#### Following the commands
More than anything, once I was able to get the Raspberry Pi set up and fully functioning, I logged into the raspberry pi and started running the commands on the slide lecture
