# Lab 4 â€” Django and Flask

### Summary
For Lab 4, I used the Raspberry Pi from Lab 2 to install some required python packages.
I used Dr. Lu's [Lesson 4](https://github.com/kevinwlu/iot/tree/master/lesson4) to guide me through this.

#### Following the Commands
I logged into the Raspberry Pi and started following the slides and the Lesson 4 IoT for the lab, as listed below.

I began to follow the Lesson 4 Github to install Django and Django REST framework.

##### Django
Once everything I needed was installed, I followed the [stevens](https://github.com/kevinwlu/iot/tree/master/lesson4/stevens) github to create what I needed.

I downloaded the MariaDB to be able to use the SQlite. I also followed the rest of the setup for the Django server, but wasn't able to get the actual ip website to pop up.

#### Django REST
For Django REST, I followed very similar steps for the ones needed for Django. I followed the [mycpu](https://github.com/kevinwlu/iot/tree/master/lesson4/stevenshttps://github.com/kevinwlu/iot/tree/master/lesson4/mycpu) github.
I was able to get everything done, except for the fact that I had same problem as last task, where the actual ip website wouldn't open.

#### Flask
Unfortunately with Flask, I also had the same problem where VNC viewer wasn't working.
