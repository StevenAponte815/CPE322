# Lab 8 â€” Data Analysis

### Summary
For Lab 8, I used the raspberry pi to install some Python packages.
I used Dr. Lu's [Lesson 8](https://github.com/kevinwlu/iot/tree/master/lesson8) to guide me through this.

#### Following the Commands
I essentially followed the slides on the lecture to get this lab started.

I was able to install everything I had to, but had some problems with TensorFlow.
